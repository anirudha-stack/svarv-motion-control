sentence=Arduino library for controlling CAN-based BLDC motor controllers
paragraph=The Svarv Motion Control library provides a simple, intuitive interface for controlling multiple CAN-based BLDC motor controllers. Inspired by industry-leading libraries like SimpleFOC, ODrive, and VESC, this library abstracts the complexity of CAN communication while providing full access to advanced motor control features including position, velocity, and torque control modes, real-time telemetry, advanced PID tuning, and comprehensive error handling.
