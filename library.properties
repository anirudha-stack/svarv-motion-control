sentence=Cross-platform Arduino library for controlling CAN-based BLDC motor controllers
paragraph=The Svarv Motion Control library provides a simple, intuitive interface for controlling multiple CAN-based BLDC motor controllers across different microcontroller platforms. Supporting ESP32 (built-in CAN), STM32 (built-in CAN), and Arduino AVR/Generic platforms with MCP2515 CAN shields. Inspired by industry-leading libraries like SimpleFOC, ODrive, and VESC, this library abstracts both CAN communication and platform differences while providing full access to advanced motor control features including position, velocity, and torque control modes, real-time telemetry, advanced PID tuning, and comprehensive error handling.
